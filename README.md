# Comic Insights: Phase 1 - Comic Strip Context Extraction

## Overview

This project builds upon **MagiV2** by **Ragav Sachdeva et al.** and extends its functionality by integrating **DeepSeek R1** for AI-powered summarization. Phase 1 focuses on extracting and summarizing textual content from comic strips using OCR (Tesseract) and AI-based summarization models.

## Features

- **Comic Page Upload:** Accepts JPEG/PNG images of comic pages.
- **OCR Text Extraction:** Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from speech bubbles and captions.
- **AI-Powered Summarization:** Utilizes DeepSeek R1 (via Ollama) to generate concise summaries.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Gradio for an easy-to-use interface.

## Acknowledgments

This project is built on the **MagiV2** framework, developed by **Ragav Sachdeva et al.** The original repository can be found here:

- [MagiV2 Repository](https://github.com/ragavsachdeva/magi)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Tesseract OCR (`pytesseract`)
- Ollama (for DeepSeek R1 integration)
- PyTorch with CUDA (for GPU acceleration)

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/adiavolo/Comic-Insights-Phase-1-Comic-Extraction.git
cd Comic-Insights-Phase-1-Comic-Extraction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed and configured
# For Linux
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
# For macOS
brew install tesseract
# For Windows 9with chocolatey)
choco install tesseract

# Run the Gradio interface
python run_with_webUI.py
```

## Usage

1. **Upload comic images** via the Gradio web interface.
2. **Extracted text** will be displayed after OCR processing.
3. **AI-generated summaries** will appear after processing with DeepSeek R1.
4. **Download or copy the transcript and summary** for further use.
